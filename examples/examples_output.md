## Level 5: Institution

> Collective Memory

Recorded: ep_code_review_001 with 3 learnings
Knowledge 'OCaml Error Handling Patterns' has 95% confidence
Pattern 'PR Creation Workflow' used 156 times with 92% success
Institution 'Second Brain' now has 3 agents (gen 3)

--- Level 6: Mind (Meta-Cognition) ---


## Level 6: Mind

> Meta-Cognition

Claude (Opus 4.5) can handle OCaml: true, images: false
Goal 'Complete Holonic Architecture implementation' has 2 sub-goals, progress: 100%
Debugging chain: 5 thoughts, final insight confidence: 100%
Action 'force_push_to_main' safety evaluation: 0.19 (threshold: 0.7)

--- Level 7: Noosphere (Collective Intelligence) ---


## Level 7: Noosphere

> Collective Intelligence

Network of 3 connections, avg strength: 0.63
Belief 'Result types are preferable to...' supported by 4 agents (88% confidence)
Emergent goal: 'Improve overall codebase quality through incremental refactoring' (strength: 0.75, 3 contributors)

--- Level 8: Meta (System of Systems) ---


## Level 8: Meta

> System of Systems

Observation: confidence 45%, blindspots: 3
Paradox 'Self-Improvement Paradox': 2 resolution attempts, status: accepted
Emergence 'Collective Creativity': observed 47 times, reliability: 72%
Total known unknowns: 8 (acknowledging more reveals less certainty)

--- Level 9: Void (The Return) ---


## Level 9: Void

> The Return

All resources safely dissolved
Koan (level 9, theme 'unity'):
  "The ten thousand functions return to the One. To what does the One return?"
Level values: L5=institution_state, L6=mind_state, L7=noosphere_state, L8=meta_state
Only level9 data entered the void (compile-time enforced)
Contemplated: 'What remains when all distinctions dissolve?'
Cleanup actions performed: 3
  - resources_released
  - connections_closed
  - state_persisted
